This is my Capstone Project which represents an Perfume Inventory Tracker which is an online website developed as a collaborative group project. Our team utilized Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Git, and AWS technologies to create this application. The project is not fully completed, but my group made significant strides within the given time frame to deliver a functional and user-friendly platform. Key features of the Perfume Inventory Tracker include user authentication for privacy and security, inventory management capabilities for adding, updating, and deleting perfume entries, as well as search and filtering options for easy retrieval of specific perfumes. As the project manager, I oversaw the team's efforts and coordinated the development process. My group and I did our best to create a valuable tool for perfume management, considering the project's scope and timeline.
